			<p> BlindDogCoin  | Launching Now! | Experienced devs | Locked liquidity | Great tokenomics! | 
			Hi there guys ! Today I will be bringing attention to a brand new project that I have come acrross! It is called BlindDogCoin and for me it ticks all the boxes and things I look for when researching and investing into a new project!<br>

			An overview of BlindDogCoin:<br>

			üîê Locked Liquidity, <br>

			‚úÖ Verified Contract, our contract is verified, this means anyone can take a read through it when they please.<br>

			üê≥ Anti-Whale System, we have a anti-whale system, so only a maximum of 10T can be made per transaction.<br>

			üè™ Marketing Wallet and Charity Wallet, we will have a marketing wallet and charity wallet, this wallet will gain 2 percent each per transaction that is taken place.<br>

			BlindDogCoin Tokenomics<br>

			BlindDogCoin is a hyper-deflationary token, all holders will be rewarded for holding tokens via static reflection.<br>

			So what exactly happens every time a transaction takes place? 4 percent will be sent over to our liquidity pool, growing our liquidity so that our lowest floor point will constantly keep rising. A further 4 percent is then equally split amongst all holders depending on how many tokens are being held by them.<br>

			Then a further 4 percent will go into the marketing and Charity Wallet (2% to each wallet, which will be used to market this token and the development of our application). We will also be having a anti-whale system in place so a maximum transaction of 10T tokens can only take place at a time!<br>
